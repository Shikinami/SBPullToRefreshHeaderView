# SBPullToRefreshHeaderView ##########################################

Yet another view for "pull-to-refresh":

- Using xib for ui design
- View controller does NOT need to forward UIScrollViewDelegate
- Using custom "reload" image like Twitter for OS X
- Using ARC (so it can run on only iOS5 or later)
